# iOS Build Issues - Resolution Summary

## Overview
This document details the iOS build issues encountered in the DevFest Nantes Kotlin Multiplatform project and the comprehensive fixes applied. The iOS app build was failing due to multiple interconnected issues involving SwiftGen resource generation and Kotlin/Native compilation compatibility.

## Final Status: ✅ RESOLVED
The iOS app now builds successfully and runs on iPhone 16 Pro simulator (iOS 18.3.1).

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. SwiftGen Path Resolution Issues ✅ FIXED

#### Problem
SwiftGen configuration had incorrect path resolution, causing resource files to not be found during the build process:
- SwiftGen config runs from the Xcode project directory but looked for resources with wrong relative paths
- Input/output directory configurations were misaligned with the actual file structure
- Build phase script execution context didn't match the config expectations

#### Error Messages
```
swiftgen: error: File SwiftGen not found.
swiftgen: error: It seems like there was an error running SwiftGen.
```

#### Root Cause Analysis
- **Config Location**: `iosApp/SwiftGen/swiftgen.yml`
- **Execution Context**: SwiftGen runs from `/Users/robin/Development/Android/DevFestNantes/iosApp`
- **Resources Location**: `iosApp/Resources/en.lproj/Localizable.strings` and `iosApp/Resources/Assets.xcassets`
- **Problem**: Relative paths in config didn't resolve correctly from execution context

#### Solution Applied
1. **Updated swiftgen.yml configuration** to use correct relative paths from execution context
2. **Modified Xcode build phase script** in `project.pbxproj` to ensure SwiftGen runs from the correct working directory
3. **Verified resource file locations** and adjusted input paths accordingly

#### Files Modified
- `iosApp/SwiftGen/swiftgen.yml` - Corrected input/output paths
- `iosApp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` - Updated build phase script execution context

### 2. Kotlin/Native Compilation Compatibility ✅ FIXED

#### Problem
After fixing SwiftGen, the build progressed further but failed during Kotlin/Native compilation with version compatibility issues between KSP and Kotlin.

#### Error Messages
```
No such extension point 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.plugin.KotlinSourceSetProcessor'
```

#### Root Cause Analysis
- **Kotlin Version**: `2.2.0`
- **Original KSP Version**: `2.1.21-2.0.1` (incompatible)
- **Issue**: KSP version was too old for Kotlin 2.2.0, causing extension point registration failures

#### Solution Applied
Updated KSP version in `gradle/libs.versions.toml` to be compatible with Kotlin 2.2.0:
```toml
# Before
ksp = "2.1.21-2.0.1"

# After  
ksp = "2.2.0-2.0.2"
```

#### Files Modified
- `gradle/libs.versions.toml` - Updated KSP version for Kotlin 2.2.0 compatibility

## Build Process Validation

### Pre-Fix Status
1. ❌ SwiftGen script execution - **FAILING**
2. ❌ Kotlin/Native framework compilation - **BLOCKED**
3. ❌ Final app bundle creation - **BLOCKED**

### Post-Fix Status  
1. ✅ SwiftGen resource generation - **WORKING**
2. ✅ Kotlin/Native framework linking - **WORKING**
3. ✅ iOS app compilation and linking - **WORKING**
4. ✅ App bundle creation - **WORKING**
5. ✅ Simulator deployment - **WORKING**

### Verification Steps Completed
1. **Manual SwiftGen execution** - Confirmed resource files generate correctly
2. **Gradle framework compilation** - `./gradlew :shared:linkDebugFrameworkIosSimulatorArm64` succeeds
3. **Full iOS build** - App builds and runs successfully on iPhone 16 Pro simulator (iOS 18.3.1)

## Generated Assets
The fixed build now properly generates:
- `Strings.swift` - Localization constants from `Localizable.strings`
- `Assets.swift` - Asset catalog constants from `Assets.xcassets`
- Kotlin/Native framework for iOS integration
- Complete iOS app bundle ready for deployment

## Technical Details

### SwiftGen Configuration Structure
```yaml
# Final working configuration structure
input_dir: ../
output_dir: SwiftGen/
strings:
  inputs: iosApp/Resources/en.lproj/Localizable.strings
  outputs: SwiftGen/Strings.swift
xcassets:
  inputs: iosApp/Resources/Assets.xcassets
  outputs: SwiftGen/Assets.swift
```

### Dependency Versions (Final)
- Kotlin: `2.2.0`
- KSP: `2.2.0-2.0.2`
- Swift Package Manager dependencies: All resolved successfully

## Lessons Learned
1. **Path Resolution Context**: SwiftGen configuration paths must be relative to the script execution directory, not the config file location
2. **Version Compatibility**: Kotlin Multiplatform projects require careful version alignment between Kotlin, KSP, and related tools
3. **Incremental Debugging**: Fixing one issue (SwiftGen) revealed the next (KSP compatibility), requiring systematic troubleshooting

## Prevention Measures
1. **Version Alignment**: Always verify KSP compatibility when updating Kotlin versions
2. **Path Testing**: Test SwiftGen configuration manually before relying on build integration
3. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of working directory contexts for build scripts

This resolution ensures the iOS app builds reliably and integrates properly with the Kotlin Multiplatform shared code.

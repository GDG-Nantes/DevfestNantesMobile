// Always prefer Swift Package Manager (SPM) over CocoaPods for iOS dependencies.
// All dependencies used in build.gradle.kts or build.gradle files must always be defined in the libs.versions.toml file.
// Always use a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach: write or update tests before implementing
new features or refactoring code.
// Document the migration strategy and process in a ComposeMultiplatformMigration.md file for future talks or REX.
// Commit changes frequently as you progress with the migration to Compose Multiplatform.
// Never commit changes until all tests pass.

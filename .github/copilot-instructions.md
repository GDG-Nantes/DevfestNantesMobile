// This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project with an androidApp and an iosApp modules.
// Always prefer Swift Package Manager (SPM) over CocoaPods for iOS dependencies.
// All dependencies used in build.gradle.kts or build.gradle files must always be defined in the libs.versions.toml file.

Always add your findings on the iOS build issues to the `IOS_BUILD_ISSUES.md` file in the root directory of the project.
// This file is used to track and document any issues encountered during the iOS build process,
